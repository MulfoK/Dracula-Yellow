# Dracula-Yellow
TonyStr's Dracula Theme and YellowAfterLife's GameMaker-Yellow combined!
This is a fun little thing I made after getting sick of the "Normal" GameMaker look.
So, I combined TonyStr's Dracula Theme and YellowAfterLife's GameMaker-Yellow.
Please enjoy!

HOW TO USE?

Well, first you'll want to extract the .zip file and then press WIN+R.
This'll open up the run command.

Inside the box type in: %programdata%\GameMakerStudio2\Skins

Then, drag the extracted folder into this folder.

Now, go into GameMaker, and under Preferences, go to general settings and change your theme!

Huzzah! Once you restart the IDE you should have the new theme loaded. Enjoy!
